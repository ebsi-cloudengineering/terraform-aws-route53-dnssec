# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Managed Key (CMK)
  for Route53 DNS to use as a Key-signing Key (KSK) for enabling DNSSEC on a Hosted Zone.

  Provides the ability to instantiate a single KMS key to be used for multiple hosted zones.

  The KSK is setup using a random string. The CMK has an AWS recommended IAM key policy applied
  to it and is created as an Asymmetric ECC_NIST_P256/ECDSA_SHA_256 key as required.

  **IMPORTANT:** Route53 requires the KMS key be provisioned in the `us-east-1` region. If including
  within a root module configured in another region then a provider alias must be passwd when using this
  module.

  ### Major Changes (breaking and otherwise)

  With the v1.0.0 release of this module, it has undergone major breaking changes and added
  new functionality. Efforts were made to not create these breaking changes but they were
  unavailable due to the nature of the issues fixed. Please see the [migration](MIGRATION.md)
  document for details.

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) 
  and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  # Create a standard label resource. See [null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/#terraform-null-label--)
  module "label" {
    source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
    # version = "x.x.x"

    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "example"
  }

  module "example" {
    source  = "ugns/route53-dnssec/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    zones = {
      "example.com" = {
        zone_id = "Z8VLZEXAMPLE"
      }
    }
  
    context = module.label.this
  }
